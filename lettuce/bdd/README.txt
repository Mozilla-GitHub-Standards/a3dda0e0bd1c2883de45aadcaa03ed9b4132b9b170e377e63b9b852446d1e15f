I was have been using python 2.6, but will likely upgrade to 2.7 soon.

Required python bundles to run these tests using "pip install <bundle>":

numpy
lettuce*


* As for Lettuce, I made an addition to Lettuce to support HTML output of results (stolen from Cucumber).  So if you'd like to install that instead, checkout the source from:
   >>git://github.com/camd/lettuce.git
In that directory, type: python install setup.py
